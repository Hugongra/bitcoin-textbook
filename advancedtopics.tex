\section{Payment Channels}
\label{sec:payment-channels}
Payment channels is a class of techniques that allows two participants to make multiple Bitcoin transactions without committing all of those transactions to the blockchain; i.e. most of the transactions are off-chain.

The Bitcoin wiki lists\footnote{https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Payment\_channels} several approaches to implement Payment Channels. We will only go through some of them including the one currently used in the Lightning Network.

\begin{itemize}
\item Nakamoto high-frequency transactions
\item \textbf{Spillman-style payment channels}
\item \textbf{CLTV-style payment channels}
\item \textbf{Poon-Dryja payment channels}
\item Decker-Wattenhofer duplex payment channels
\item Decker-Russell-Osuntokun eltoo Channels (eltoo; requires SIGHASH\_INPUT)
\end{itemize}
